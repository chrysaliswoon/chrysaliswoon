## Hey There! I'm Chrysalis :wave:	

I'm a Learning & Instructional Designer focused on developing programming centric courses and programs for students ages 5 and above for online and offline purposes. I am currently going more towards the Tech side of things in the EdTech world by attending General Assembly's Software Engineering program. 

My expertise include deep understanding of various learning models, project management skills, visual and artistic talents, and assessment development. 

Currently I am seeking opportunities that will allow me to play a key role in identifying, designing, and incorporating appropriate Edtech plans, tools and programs into a school's learning environment. This includes any role related to project or product management in the Education and/or Technology sector.
